** Capstone - Knowledge Definition DSL and Website
- *Objective*: Design and implement a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for knowledge definition inspired by RDF, manage dependencies between knowledge modules using Nix, and create a static website to display and explore the defined knowledge.
- *Target Audience*: Programmers who have completed the curriculum and are ready to synthesize their skills into a comprehensive project.
- *Structure*: 6 phases, each with specific goals, activities, and resources.

*** Setup Instructions
- Ensure all necessary tools from the curriculum are installed:
  - Haskell: `nix-env -i ghc` (for DSL implementation)
  - Nix: Pre-installed on NixOS (for dependency management)
  - Hakyll: `nix-env -i haskellPackages.hakyll` (for website generation)
  - Neo4j: `nix-env -i neo4j` or Docker (`docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 neo4j`) (for knowledge storage)
  - Git: `nix-env -i git` (for version control)
- Create a new project directory for the capstone: `mkdir capstone-project && cd capstone-project`

*** Phase 1: DSL Design
- *Description*: Define the syntax and semantics of your DSL, modeled after RDF for knowledge definition.
- *Goals*: Create a clear, expressive language for defining knowledge as triples (subject-predicate-object) with modular support.
- *Activities*:
  1. Study RDF to understand its triple-based structure and modularity (e.g., namespaces).
  2. Design a simple grammar for your DSL (e.g., "entity predicate value" or Turtle-like syntax).
  3. Plan how knowledge modules will depend on each other (e.g., importing shared definitions).
  4. Write a sample DSL file for a small knowledge domain (e.g., programming concepts).
- *Resources*:
  - [RDF 1.1 Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)
  - [Turtle Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/)

*** Phase 2: DSL Implementation
- *Description*: Implement the DSL in Haskell, creating a parser and interpreter.
- *Goals*: Build a working DSL that can parse and process knowledge definitions.
- *Activities*:
  1. Use Megaparsec to write a parser for your DSL syntax.
  2. Define an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in Haskell to represent parsed DSL statements.
  3. Implement an interpreter to convert the AST into an in-memory knowledge graph.
  4. Test the parser and interpreter with your sample DSL file.
- *Note*: You asked about implementing the DSL *in Nix*. Nix is excellent for dependency management but not suited for DSL implementation (it’s a build system, not a programming language for parsing/interpreting). Haskell is a better choice due to its strong type system and parser libraries, which align with curriculum skills.
- *Resources*:
  - [Megaparsec Tutorial](https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/megaparsec.html)
  - [Haskell AST Design](https://wiki.haskell.org/Abstract_syntax_tree)

*** Phase 3: Knowledge Module Management with Nix
- *Description*: Use Nix to manage dependencies between knowledge modules.
- *Goals*: Ensure knowledge modules are modular, reproducible, and dependency-aware.
- *Activities*:
  1. Define each knowledge module as a Nix derivation (e.g., a DSL file or Haskell package).
  2. Use Nix’s dependency system (e.g., `import`) to link modules that depend on each other.
  3. Write a top-level Nix expression to build the full knowledge base reproducibly.
  4. Test by building a multi-module knowledge base with dependencies.
- *Resources*:
  - [Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/)
  - [NixOS Wiki: Haskell](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Haskell)

*** Phase 4: Integrating with Neo4j
- *Description*: Store and query your DSL-defined knowledge in Neo4j.
- *Goals*: Persist the knowledge graph and enable querying.
- *Activities*:
  1. Map DSL constructs (e.g., triples) to Neo4j nodes and relationships.
  2. Use the Neo4j Haskell driver to insert parsed DSL data into Neo4j.
  3. Write Cypher queries to retrieve and explore the knowledge graph.
  4. Validate the integration with your sample knowledge base.
- *Resources*:
  - [Neo4j Cypher Manual](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/)
  - [Neo4j Haskell Driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-haskell)

*** Phase 5: Building the Website with Hakyll
- *Description*: Create a static website to display and explore the knowledge graph.
- *Goals*: Make the knowledge accessible and interactive online.
- *Activities*:
  1. Use Hakyll to generate HTML pages from your Neo4j-stored knowledge base.
  2. Add a basic JavaScript interface for searching or browsing the knowledge graph.
  3. Incorporate a graph visualization library (e.g., Cytoscape.js) to display relationships.
  4. Style the site with CSS for usability and accessibility.
- *Resources*:
  - [Hakyll Documentation](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
  - [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
  - [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

*** Phase 6: Deployment and Reflection
- *Description*: Deploy the website and reflect on the project.
- *Goals*: Share your work publicly and evaluate your learning experience.
- *Activities*:
  1. Build the static site using Hakyll (`hakyll build`).
  2. Deploy to a hosting provider (e.g., Hostinger) via FTP or Git.
  3. Write a 3-4 page reflection in Org-mode, addressing:
     - Design choices and challenges faced.
     - How curriculum skills supported the project.
     - Ideas for future enhancements.
- *Resources*:
  - [Hostinger FTP Guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-use-ftp)
  - [Org-mode Documentation](https://orgmode.org/manual/)

*** Skill Gaps to Address
- *Haskell Proficiency*: Ensure you’re comfortable with Haskell’s type system and monads (used heavily in DSL implementation). Add practice if needed earlier in the curriculum.
- *Parser Combinators*: Learn Megaparsec or Parsec for DSL parsing—include a tutorial or exercise in the Haskell section.
- *Nix Dependency Management*: Gain experience defining and linking dependencies in Nix. Add a small Nix-based project earlier in the curriculum.
- *Web Development Basics*: Brush up on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if rusty—consider a mini-project in the web development section.
- *Graph Visualization*: Explore Cytoscape.js or similar tools for the website. Include an optional intro in the web or graph theory section.
